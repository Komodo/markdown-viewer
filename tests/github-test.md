# GitHub MD syntax test

This is intended as a quick reference and showcase. For more complete info, see
[John Gruber's original spec](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
and the [Github-flavored Markdown info page](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).

## 1. Headers

    # H1
    ## H2
    ### H3
    #### H4
    ##### H5
    ###### H6
    
    Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:
    
    Alt-H1
    ======
    
    Alt-H2
    ------

# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

Alt-H1
======

Alt-H2
------

## 2. Emphasis

    Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.
    
    Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.
    
    Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.
    
    Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## 3. Lists

(In this example, leading and trailing spaces are shown with with dots: ⋅)

```markdown
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

## 4. Links

```markdown
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself]

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com
```

## 6. Code and Syntax Highlighting

There actually should be backticks instead of single quote characters.

```markdown
'''javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
'''
 
'''python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
'''
 

'''html
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Test</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
'''

'''
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
'''
```

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```html
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Test</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

```css
div { position: absolute }
div.test {
    background-image: url("image.png");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```


## 7. Tables

```markdown
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
```

## 8. Blockquotes

```markdown
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

## 9. Inline HTML

```markdown
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>
```

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>
  
  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

## 10. Horizontal Rule
